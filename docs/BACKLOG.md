# justmy.website — backlog & tracker

Running tracker for outstanding work, deferred decisions, and refinements. Newest context at
the top of each section.

## Build roadmap

- [x] Infra: git, Neon, Clerk, tokens, USDA key (provisioned + verified)
- [x] Data layer: Drizzle schema (live on Neon), Neon client
- [x] Zod schema + normalization
- [x] Repo + day-rollup (live-tested)
- [x] USDA resolver (mapper + cache-on-first-resolve)
- [x] Auth/http kernel (two-token, error envelope, pagination)
- [x] Token API routes (CRUD + rollup + USDA; 20 live smoke checks)
- [x] Next 16 skeleton (Clerk, next/font, Tailwind theme, proxy)
- [x] **UI Phase 1** — AppShell chrome + DayRollup hero (approved)
- [x] **UI Phase 2** — EntryList/EntryRow + add-entry prompt + day-navigation row + sticky-shell fix
      (chrome fixed, only content scrolls) (approved)
- [x] **UI Phase 3** — real data via repo (server components), day nav (links), day-kind persist +
      entry correct/soft-delete (server actions), Clerk UserButton, seed script. Option A: the web
      corrects + deletes entries; *adding* is Claude's path (skill). Add-entry prompt is a non-wired
      placeholder until the skill lands.
- [x] **Root landing** (Index) — gated `/` module list (macros LIVE, shopping SOON) + no-flash
      theme script in the root layout (persisted theme applied before paint, app-wide).
- [ ] **UI Phase 4** — mobile/responsive pass, handled in code (not a separate design spec).
      Reflow: nav rail → compact top bar/drawer, macro grid 3-col → 1-col, entry table → stacked,
      hero corridor full-width. Reviewed live like the other phases.
- [ ] Skill + Python client (`manage-macros`) — Claude's write path over the token API
- [ ] `scripts/build-openapi.mjs` (generate OpenAPI from Zod) + `scripts/build-skills.mjs`
- [ ] First deploy (add `JMW_*` Preview env; push to GitHub)

## UI refinements

- **DayRollup hero corridor legibility.** When the day is "in range" (unspecified), the value fill
  is solid cyan and the corridor band is also cyan-tinted, so they blend and the "honest corridor"
  reads less crisply than it should — and it's the single most important element. Proposed: make the
  value fill more translucent, strengthen the corridor's accent hairline edges, and make the
  text-colored value marker more prominent, so the total visibly sits *within* the rest→training
  corridor. (Raised Phase 1; approved look otherwise.)

## Deferred decisions

- **Clerk lockdown = Restricted sign-up mode + a manually-created user** (allowlist is Clerk Pro-
  only, not needed). **Production instance** already configured (email-only, Restricted, Curtis's
  user) — done early; still needs a real/verified domain to activate at deploy.
  **Development instance** (what local dev + the `_test_` keys use) is NOT yet configured — mirror
  the same settings there if we want the locked-down flow locally; otherwise dev defaults to public
  sign-up (fine for local, your machine only).
- **Mobile handled in code, not designed.** No separate mobile design spec — the design system is
  established and the web UI's mobile role is review-focused (logging goes through Claude, not the
  form). Responsive reflow done in code (Phase 4), reviewed live. Revisit a design ref only if the
  signature hero's small-screen treatment needs bespoke attention.
- **EntryRow "time" column.** The design's EntryRow grid includes a time column, but the data model
  deliberately stores no entry time (date-keyed only, no meal slots). Phase 2 drops the time column.
  Revisit only if we ever decide to store entry timestamps (currently out of scope).
- **USDA branded foods.** The resolver maps `foodNutrients` as per-100g (correct for Foundation /
  SR Legacy / Survey). Branded foods carry per-serving `labelNutrients`; if branded logging matters,
  add per-serving→per-100g normalization. Currently we prefer the cleaner per-100g data types.
- **Local sign-in pages.** Using Clerk hosted sign-in for now (fine for a 2-user tool). Add
  `app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]` + `app/sign-up` and the `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL` env vars if we
  want the auth flow on our own domain.

## Tech debt / cleanup

- **`TZ` for "today".** `todayISO()` uses the server's local date. Vercel runs UTC, so set a `TZ`
  env var (Curtis's timezone) in production, or compute "today" via `Intl` with an explicit zone —
  otherwise the `/macros` redirect lands on the wrong day near midnight for a UTC-negative user.

- **`/preview` route** is dev-only (404s in prod, guarded in proxy). Keep as a component preview
  harness or remove before/at first deploy — decide at deploy time.
- **API observability.** Route handlers have no per-request logging (Vercel function logs cover the
  basics). Add structured logging/error tracking if debugging needs it.
- **Preview env for `JMW_*` tokens.** Skipped due to an outdated Vercel CLI quirk; add before the
  first preview deploy (or after `npm i -g vercel@latest`).
